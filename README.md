Here's all the projects I've worked on that I can share publicly! I haven't uploaded school projects or any src code related to my startups/research to avoid complications.

Table of Contents:

Social Pay (FULLSTACK): A concept where I view social concepts as financial assets that can be bought and sold and that have a value. Fully open source!


Research (VIRTUAL REALITY / EMBEDDED SOFTWARE / ML): My 1.5 years of research at GT's EPIC Lab where I worked on some (classified) applications of robotics, ML, and VR
to help humans avoid threats and moving obstacles with the help of an exoskeleton!


Tootly (SYSTEM DESIGN / FRONTEND): Full System Design 


AirBnb Price Predictor (ML/AI): Using unsupervised and supervised learning, we can generate a price the owner should charge for their property based on factors like neighborhood, location, room type, and number of total reviews


Multivariable Calculus Bot (PYTHON): I couldn't find any easy-to-use tools for calculating some of the harder/ weirder problems in Math 2551, so I made my own
(I seem to have lost the bigger more robust version, but I do have a version which solves quite a few of the problem types).


Nintendo Game (C / Game Dev): A game for Game Boy where players have to race to a randomly generated goal.
