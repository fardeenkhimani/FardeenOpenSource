Here's all the projects I've worked on that I can share publicly! I haven't uploaded school projects or any src code related to my startups/research to avoid complications.

Table of Contents:

Social Pay : A concept where I view social concepts as financial assets that can be bought and sold and that have a value. Fully open source!

Research: My 1.5 years of research at GT's EPIC Lab where I worked on some (classified) applications of robotics, ML, and VR
          to help humans avoid threats and moving obstacles with the help of an exoskeleton! 

SparkPlug: 

My goKart: Plans and Process behind a goKart my friends and I built from scratch. Hopefully you can avoid the pitfalls we faced in building ours.

Tootly: 

Multivariable Calculus Bot: I couldn't find any easy to use tools for calculating some of the weirder problems in Math 2551, so I made my own
                            (I seem to have lost the bigger more robust version, but I do have a version which solves quite a few of the problem types).

Nintendo Game: A game for Game Boy where players have to race to a randomly generated goal.
