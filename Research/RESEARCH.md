# Fardeen's Research

For 1.5 years, I worked at Georgia Tech's EPIC Labs as an undergraduate researcher. I worked on developing software for an exoskeleton that can climb different terrains, 
dodge obstacles, and much more! Specifically, I worked on embedded software, virtual reality, reinforcement learning, and data collection/ vizualization primarily in:
Unity, C#, C, Matlab, and Python.

Given this project develops for the U.S. Army and is only for U.S. Citizens, I cannot share much of the source code or details of what I worked on.
However, here's all the cool code, videos, and pictures I CAN share!
