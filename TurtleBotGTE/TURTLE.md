From Jan 2024 to May 2024, I worked on building an autonomus robot (turtle bot) that can localise using aruco markers, map wifi strength, do facial recognition, path plan, explore a room (frontier exploration), and do collision avoidance.

A picture the turtlebot took of me and my group. \

The Turtle bot whose name is Hungry Hippo. (Kobuki - diff drive, ground, indoor robot). \

The Kinext camera on the robot can do facial recognition. \
