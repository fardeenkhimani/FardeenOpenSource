# Fardeen's Research

For 1.5 years, I worked at Georgia Tech's EPIC Labs as an undergraduate researcher. I worked on developing software for an exoskeleton that can climb different terrains, 
dodge obstacles, and much more! Specifically, I worked on embedded software, virtual reality, reinforcement learning, and data collection/ vizualization primarily in:
Unity, C#, C, Matlab, and Python.

Given this project develops for the U.S. Army and is only for U.S. Citizens, I cannot share much of the source code or details of what I worked on.
However, here's all the cool code, videos, and pictures I CAN share!

A Picture of me in the Exo:

An exemplified application of my open source LURD algorithm on an overhead drone tracking a soldier.
For source code and to use the algorithm, view the Java file!

Unity Work:

One of the labs goals was to make a model to decide how to move an exo user based on his/her proximity to threats of varying danger levels. I created a simulation in Unity that calculates how much resistance or assistance to give an exo user based on their posiiton and distance from moving cars using Artificial Potential Fields and Unity.

A goal of the exo is to also dodge intelligent human-like enemies. In order to simulate this, I used Unity and the MLAgents Library to create and train AI enemies to track down the exo like a human would with three difficulty levels. I then had the exo try to dodge these intelligent enemies for as long as it could using algorithms.
